When you try to delete a world on the first time, the world will be moved to the Minecraft 'backups' folder,
and the world will appear as a 'deleted world' in the world list. You can toggle to view these deleted world
by clicking on the button in the top right corner of select world screen. 

You can try to delete again a deleted world, but this time the world will be gone for good.

This mod also modifies the vanilla backup feature (by clicking 'Edit' and then 'Create Backup') so that it does not zip the world file.
This is to standardise the backup process when you delete a world that has not yet been deleted.
Zipping prevents the mod to read the world metadata such as level name, world icon, etc.
